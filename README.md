# Face Recoginition, Emotion, Age and Gender Detection in One System
 
The objective of the project was to have face recoginition, emotion detection, age and gender estimation in one system. We first tested the three systems individually and then went forward to combine them. 

## Getting Started
We implemented the project on a Windows machine using Spyder IDE and TensorFlow 1.x. I have updated the code to be compatible with TensorFlow 2.0.
